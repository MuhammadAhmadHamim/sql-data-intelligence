--Every minister that sits on an even numbered sit in the government is considered a "safe" minister. 
--Your job is to return all of the "safe" ministers seats that want to continue serving in the next government
--while excluding any minister who spoke a bad word.
--The result should contain only the relevant sits.
--Before starting to solve the challenge take a look at the table data.
--It is not clean. The columns is_next_gov and is_spoke_bad contain ones and zeros and also yes's and no's.
SELECT seat
FROM ministers
WHERE seat % 2 = 0 AND
(is_next_gov IS TRUE OR is_next_gov LIKE "yes") AND
(is_spoke_bad IS NOT TRUE OR is_spoke_bad LIKE "no")
