--Create a query that calculates the following:

--A column called total_value that multiplies the price by quantity and adds a fixed shipping cost of 15
--A column called discounted_value that:
--First multiplies the price by quantity
--Then applies a 20% discount (multiply by 0.8)
--Finally adds a fixed shipping cost of 10
--Try to use parentheses appropriately to ensure the calculations are performed in the correct order!
SELECT (price * quantity) + 15 AS total_value,
       ((price * quantity) * 0.8) + 10 AS discounted_value
FROM products;
