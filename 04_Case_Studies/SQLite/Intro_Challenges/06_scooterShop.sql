/*
As the manager of a scooter shop, you have noticed that many scooters are not original, meaning they are missing a model name.
Furthermore, bad scooters typically do not have lights.

Your task involves two steps:

First, Add to all scooter prices in the shop the overall average price.
Then, Calculate the average price for each brand, considering only good and original scooters
(i.e., scooters with a model name and lights).
The result should include the brand and the average price - avg_price.
Sort the results by the average price in ascending order.

SELECT brand,AVG(price) AS avg_price
FROM (SELECT model, brand, has_lights, price + 
       (SELECT AVG(price) FROM scooters) AS price
       FROM scooters 
) 
WHERE  model IS NOT NULL
AND has_lights IS TRUE
GROUP BY brand
ORDER BY avg_price
